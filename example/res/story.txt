// First

The sun has almost set by the time you arrive in the crumbling city of Dravenhold. 
Shadows stretch long and sharp over the cracked cobblestones, and the air is heavy with decay. 
You are here for one purpose: to kill the monster.

---

A faint voice calls out, halting your steps.  

- walk to beast nest : Church
- aproach voice : Talk


# Talk

Turning, you find a wounded city guard slumped against a wall, clutching a deep wound in his side. 
“It’s fast,” he wheezes, blood dripping from his lips.
“Too fast...” His eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.

[move Church]


# Church

You press on toward the towering church at the center of the city. 

The massive doors hang slightly ajar, and the scent of rot grows stronger with each step. 
You know the creature is inside.

Before you reach the door, a low, guttural growl freezes you in place. 
The monster emerges, hunched and bristling with unnatural rage.

Its voice, a rasp of human words twisted by its transformation, chills you to the bone: “You will die here.” 

In its yellowed eyes, you see a flicker of humanity - a soul begging to be freed. 
You draw your weapon.

[move Battle]

	The strike connects, your blade carving into its thick hide with a spray of black ichor.
	You hit the beast with [damage] damage.
[else]
	You miss!

	The beast is quick. It lunges, and your next swing cuts only empty air.
[end]

[move Battle]


# Victory

Breathing heavily, you steady your hand for the final blow. With a precise strike, you pierce its chest. 
The monster lets out a piercing howl, crumbling to the ground as the light in its eyes dims. The abomination is no more.
You slay the beast!
