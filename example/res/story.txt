// Start

The sky bleeds red as you and Kael cross the broken gates of Dravenhold.
Wind howls through empty alleys, carrying the scent of blood and mildew.
The city is silent - not with peace, but with something holding its breath.

[cgi slide in]

Kael: "Place gives me the creeps. Smells like death wrapped in mold."
Kael: "Whatever did this to the city... it's still here."
Kael: "I’ve got a bad feeling we’ll find it before long."

You pass shattered windows and charred doorframes. Every step echoes like a warning.
At the heart of the ruins, a cathedral looms - blackened with soot, its spire cracked like a broken fang.

[cgi slide in]

Kael: "The church. Always the church. Why is it always the damn church?"
You: "Because that’s where monsters like to nest... where the prayers die first."
Kael: "Heh. Grim. I like it."

[cgi slide out]

As you approach the grand entrance, the stench intensifies - rancid and wet.
The heavy doors creak open on their own, revealing a dark maw within.

From the shadows, a hulking creature lumbers forward - its form twisted by corruption, limbs too long, eyes glowing faintly with a desperate sorrow.
Its voice, warped and gurgling, rumbles out like a curse - “You will die here.”

[cgi slide in]

Kael: "You hear that? It remembers. Whatever it once was... it's still in there."
You: "Then let's end its suffering."

[cgi slide out]

Steel sings as you draw your weapon, stepping into the cathedral’s dying light.

# Battle

Your health is [health] and you have [potions] potions. Weapon damage is [damage]. Monster health is [monster.health].

[hit = default]

[if potions > 0]
	- Fast strike : hit = fast
	- Heavy strike       
	- Drink potion : Heal

[else]
	- Fast strike : hit = fast
	- Heavy strike       
[end]


// Hit result

[if hit = fast]
	[damage roll 20]
	[monster.health - damage]

	The strike connects, your blade carving into its thick hide with a spray of black ichor.
	You hit the beast with [damage] damage.
[else]
	You miss! The beast is quick. It lunges, and your next swing cuts only empty air.
[end]

# Heal

[potions - 1]
[health + 20]

You drink healing potion.

[move Battle]


# Victory

[enemy slide out]

The creature stumbles, weakened, its breath ragged. You seize the moment.
With one final thrust, you drive your blade into its chest. It lets out a strangled scream, then collapses, twitching.
The glow in its eyes fades to nothing.

[cgi slide in]

Kael: "It’s done. Poor soul."
Kael: "It can rest now."
Kael: "Let’s hope it’s the last. But something tells me it’s not."

[cgi slide out]

You wipe your blade clean, heart still pounding. One monster down - but the night is far from over.
