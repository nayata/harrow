**Twine** can be used as a visual editor for writing **Harrow** stories.

By using a custom Twine story `format.js`, scenes can be tested interactively and then exported as `.twee` files for use in Harrow.

The format includes syntax highlighting and a toolbar for inserting common Harrow commands.

Passage relationships are visualized through reference links. Classic Twine-style links using double square brackets are also supported and handled automatically by `harrow.twine.Parser`.

To use the format, install it in Twine like any other custom format.
