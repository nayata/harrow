# Introduction

**Harrow** is a lightweight narrative runtime for building structured, interactive stories. It parses story scripts and executes them through a flow-based system.

Stories consist of text, character dialogue, variables, choices, actions, events and conditional logic.





See [Running](Running.md) for more information.
